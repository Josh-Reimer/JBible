# JBible
Java version of my Python BibleApp at https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/BibleApp
Built this on my phone using an app
called JvDroid! Anyway, in the target folder,
there is a jar file which you can run the
entire app. I have all the java source code 
in the src folder and the Bible text files
in a folder called Bible(think of it as assets).
