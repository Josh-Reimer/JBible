# JBible
Command line Bible app with advanced 'book chapter verse' navigation.
Effectively a Java version of my Python BibleApp at https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/BibleApp
Built this on my phone using an app
called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.jvdroid&hl=en&gl=US&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Djvdroid&pcampaignid=APPU_1_bjEhY-4om9um1A_zy5ugAw">JvDroid</a>! Anyway, in the target folder,
there is a jar file which you can run the
entire app.I have all the java source code 
in the src folder and the Bible text files
in a folder called Bible(think of it as assets).

Note:
       You may have to delete the class files
and run javac on them again if errors occur.
Also, the way JBible accesses the Bible 
text files isn't very professional and the file path is wrong.
