# JBible
Command line Bible app with advanced 'book chapter verse' navigation.
Effectively a Java version of my Python BibleApp at https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/BibleApp
Built this on my phone using an app
called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.jvdroid&hl=en&gl=US&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Djvdroid&pcampaignid=APPU_1_bjEhY-4om9um1A_zy5ugAw">JvDroid</a>! Anyway, in the target folder,
there is a jar file which you can run the
entire app.I have all the java source code 
in the src folder and the Bible text files
in a folder called bible.

# How to Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/JBible.git
cd JBible
mvn clean package
java -jar target/JBible*
```
